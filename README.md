# CTCI_SOLU

This repository contains my solutions for the interview questions on the book Cracking The Coding Interview (5th edition).

Most of the solutions are my own works. Few solutions for particularly hard questions will be modified version of the solutions in the book.

Hope you find it helpful and any comments and thoughts are welcomed!
